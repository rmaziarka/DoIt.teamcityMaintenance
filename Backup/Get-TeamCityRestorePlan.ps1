    To restore TeamCity on a clean server, please follow steps below (see also http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD8/Restoring+TeamCity+Data+from+Backup):
    1. Ensure you have a valid backup archive.
    <TODO: what if there's no java?>
    2. Download proper version of TeamCity from http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/. To check build version look into the backup archive (file BUILD.* at root of archive).
    3. Run TeamCity installation with following options:
       a) Destination folder: D:\TeamCity (or C:\TeamCity).
       b) Select components to install: uncheck whole 'Build Agent' tree (install server only).
       c) TeamCity data directory: D:\TeamCityData (or C:\TeamCityData) - must be on the same drive as 'Destination folder'.
       d) TeamCity server port: any (default 80).
       e) Run TeamCity Server under a user account.
       f) Uncheck 'Start TeamCity Server service'.
    4. Open Control Panel / System / Advanced system settings / Environment variables and ensure there is variable TEAMCITY_DATA_PATH in system variables with correct value. 
       Click OK - this is required to refresh environment variables
    5. Ensure the directory pointed by TEAMCITY_DATA_PATH exists and is empty.
    6. You have three options how to restore database:
       a) If you want to use the same database connection as in original backup, prepare the database (create empty database and set user permissions) and run:
          Restore-TeamCityData -BackupFile <pathToYourBackupFile>
       b) If you want to restore to TeamCity internal database (hsqldb - for quick and dirty non-production solution), run:
          Restore-TeamCityData -BackupFile <pathToYourBackupFile> -RestoreToInternalDatabase
       c) If you want to use a new external database connection, prepare the database (for details see http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD8/Setting+up+an+External+Database),
          create a new database.properties file (you can look at existing <your_backup.7z>\DatabaseProperties\*.dist files for reference) and run:
          Restore-TeamCityData -BackupFile <pathToYourBackupFile> -DatabasePropertiesFile <pathToUnpackedDatabasePropertiesFile>
    
       Note if you're running Restore-TeamCityServer.bat, Restore-TeamCityData cmdlet will be run automatically with specific options basing on your input.
